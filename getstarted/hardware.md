# Hardware

`DWT`'s main feature is interacting with imaging devices like scanners and cameras. In this section, we'll look at the supported devices.

- [TWAIN Scanners](#twain-scanners)
- [ICA Scanners](#ica-scanners)
- [SANE Scanners](#sane-scanners)
- [DirectShow Cameras](#directshow-cameras)
- [MediaDevices Cameras](#mediadevices-cameras)

## TWAIN Scanners

![Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-1]({{site.assets}}imgs/Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-1.png)

`TWAIN Scanners` refer to image scanners that have drivers following the TWAIN standard.

### Facts about TWAIN

* TWAIN is an application programming interface (API) and communication protocol that regulate communication between software and digital imaging devices, such as image scanners and digital cameras. 

* TWAIN is supported on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS X. However, based on our experience and the experience of many customers, TWAIN only works well on Windows. On Linux, [SANE](#sane-scanners) is the better and preferred alternative; on macOS, [ICA](#ica-scanners) is the better and preferred alternative.

* TWAIN is actively maintained by the non-profit [TWAIN Working Group](https://www.twain.org/). Members of the group consists of scanner vendors and imaging software vendors, including FUJITSU, Panasonic, Epson, HP, ExactCODE, LEADTOOLS, and of course, Dynamsoft.

* TWAIN is [the most commonly used protocol](https://www.twain.org/why-twain/) for image capturing and processing. Almost all scanners on the market come with a TWAIN driver and are supported by TWAIN applications like `DWT` .

### Is my Scanner TWAIN Compliant?

After you have installed the driver for your scanner, you can refer to the following methods to verify whether your scanner is TWAIN compliant.


* [Recommended & Easiest] Take advantage of our official demo page

  + Open the [demo page](https://demo.dynamsoft.com/dwt/online_demo_scan.aspx) on [Windows]({{site.getstarted}}platform.html#browsers-on-windows)

  > If you haven't installed DWT, a dialog will show up asking you to download and install it.

  + Make sure the scanner driver shows up in the scanner dropdown list

![Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-5]({{site.assets}}imgs/Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-5.png)

  + If the scanner appears in the dropdown, try scanning to make sure it works correctly without any errors. Errors will appear in the message box under the viewer. 

* [Recommended] Use the tool called `Twacker` which is developed by the [TWAIN Working Group](https://www.twain.org/)

  + Download and install

    > In most cases, please dowload the 32-bit version

    - [32-bit](https://download.dynamsoft.com/tool/Twack_32.msi)
    - [64-bit](https://download.dynamsoft.com/tool/Twack_64.msi)

  + Open the program

![Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-6]({{site.assets}}imgs/Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-6.png)

  + Select your device

![Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-7]({{site.assets}}imgs/Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-7.png)

  > If your device is not listed, please check if the driver is installed. Or, try running `Twacker` as admin to see if it shows up.

  + Choose the settings and try scanning

![Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-8]({{site.assets}}imgs/Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-8.png)

  > If scanning is successful without any errors, then your device should be TWAIN compliant. You can also try other commands to see how it works. If your scanner doesnâ€™t work with `TWACKER` , please check your scanner model online and make sure you have installed the (latest) TWAIN driver from its manufacturer.

![Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-9]({{site.assets}}imgs/Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-9.png)

* Refer to the official [twain-certified-drivers](https://resource.twain.org/twain-certified-drivers/). 

> This list is maintained by hardware vendors and may be incomplete. In this case, try the two ways above instead.

### No Scanner to test

If you don't have a TWAIN scanner at hand to test the library. You can download and use a virtual scanner. 

* [32-bit virtual scanner](https://www.dynamsoft.com/download/TWAIN/twainds.win32.installer.2.1.3.msi)
* [64-bit virtual scanner](https://www.dynamsoft.com/download/TWAIN/twainds.win64.installer.2.1.3.msi)

### TWAIN and WIA

`WIA` refers to [Windows Image Acquisition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wia/-wia-startpage), which is the still image acquisition platform in the Windows family that enables imaging/graphics applications to interact with imaging hardware and standardizes the interaction between different applications and scanners. 

`WIA` devices can be used by `TWAIN` applications like `DWT` through a `TWAIN compatibility layer`. This means `WIA` is not supported natively; therefore, when a device supports both `TWAIN` and `WIA` , `TWAIN` is the better option.

By comparison, `WIA` can only control a very limited set of general capabilities of the devices while `TWAIN` can control all standard and even custom capabilities of the devices. Another thing is that `TWAIN` has three transfer modes (Native, Memory, File), while `WIA` only has two (Memory, File).

## ICA Scanners

![Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-2]({{site.assets}}imgs/Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-2.png)

`ICA Scanners` refer to image scanners that have drivers designed in accordance with the [ImageCaptureCore Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imagecapturecore).

### Facts about ICA

* ICA is a framework from Apple designed to "Browse for media devices and control them programmatically from your app."

* ICA is supported on macOS X.

`SANE Scanners` refer to image scanners that have drivers designed in accordance with the [SANE API](http://www.sane-project.org/).

### Facts about SANE

* SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any raster image scanner hardware.

* SANE is supported on multiple Linux distributions.

* As of version 16.1.1, `DWT` supports SANE v1.0.25.

## FAQs

### How to exclude WIA sources in the source list

> Applicable to Windows only

There are two ways to achieve this:

* Set `IfUseTwainDSM` to `true`

``` javascript
DWObject.IfUseTwainDSM = true;
```

* Filter sources before listing them

``` javascript
var sources = DWObject.GetSourceNames();
for (var i = 0; i < sources.length; i++) {
    if (sources[i].toLowerCase().indexOf('epson') != -1) {
        sources.splice(i, 1);
    }
}
```
